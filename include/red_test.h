/*
 * RedTest - Simple C Testing Framework
 *
 *  At the beginning of your test application, create a test suite by calling:
 *
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      RedTest suite = RedTest_Begin(argv[0], NULL, NULL);
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  The first parameter is the name of test suite.  In this example we use the
 *  name of the executable from argv[0], but it may be any string.  The next
 *  two parameters are callbacks, which can be used for customized reporting
 *  and/or logging.  Setting these to NULL uses the default reporting routines,
 *  which output to stderr.
 *
 *  A test suite consists of zero or more subtests.  The routine
 *  RedTest_Verify is used to mark the completion of a subtest.
 *
 *  NOTE: There is no routine to begin a subtest.  Simply perform your test
 *  logic and call RedTest_Verify when you've determined success or failure.  
 *
 *  The result of the subtest may be computed ahead of time, or computed inside
 *  the call to RedTest_Verify.  Here is a mostly-complete example that shows
 *  both approaches:
 *
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      int Fib(int x) { return 1; } // intentionally broken
 *
 *      int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
 *      {
 *          RedTest suite = RedTest_Begin(argv[0], NULL, NULL);
 *          bool passed = (Fib(0) == 1);
 *          RedTest_Verify(suite, "Fib(0) is 1", passed);
 *          RedTest_Verify(suite, "Fib(1) is also 1", (Fib(1) == 1));
 *          RedTest_Verify(suite, "Fib(2) is 2", (Fib(2) == 2));
 *          return RedTest_End(suite);
 *      }
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  The code above will generate three subtests and track the results.  Since
 *  our fibinocci function is broken and Fib(2) returns 1 (and we're using the
 *  default reporting routines) the following will be output to stderr:
 *  
 *      ---(stderr)---------------------------------------------------------
 *      fib_test: Subtest 2 'Fib(2) is 2' failed!
 *      fib_test FAILED!  2 of 3 subtests passed.  1 failed.
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  When finished, the single routine RedTest_End reports a final summary and
 *  frees the resources used by RedTest.  Also, RedTest_End returns non-zero if
 *  any tests failed, so it can used in the application's main() return
 *  statement:
 *
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      return RedTest_End(suite);
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  If default reporting routines are being used, then a one-line final summary
 *  will printed to stderr:
 *
 *      ---(stderr)---------------------------------------------------------
 *      fib_test FAILED!  2 of 3 subtests pass.  1 failed.
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   or if things went smoothly: 
 *
 *      ---(stderr)---------------------------------------------------------
 *      fib_test PASSED.  3 subtests.
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------

 *          reporting routine is used, which prints messages to stderr.
 *          Otherwise, this must be a function that takes three parameters:
 *
 *              <RedTest> - Test suite object.
 *
 *              <const char *> - Subtest name.
 *
